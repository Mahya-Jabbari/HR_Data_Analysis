# HR_Data_Analysis

This project analyzes HR data using Python and pandas, focusing on employee statistics, absenteeism, satisfaction, and hiring trends.

## Project Overview
The notebook addresses five main analyses:

1. **Salary_Distribution**  
   Examine the distribution of employee salaries using a histogram and KDE plot. Provide insights based on the distribution.

2. **Top_Positions_by_Absences**  
   Identify positions with the highest average absences and visualize them using a bar chart.

3. **Job_Satisfaction**  
   Compare job satisfaction (`EmpSatisfaction`) between employees who left the company and those who stayed using boxplots. The `DateOfTermination` column indicates whether an employee has left.

4. **Annual_Hiring_Trend**  
   Analyze hiring trends over the years using the `DateOfHire` column to see which years had the most new hires.

5. **Projects_vs_Absences**  
   Investigate the relationship between the number of special projects (`SpecialProjectsCount`) and absences (`Absences`). Use scatter plots and correlation to explain any observed relationship.
